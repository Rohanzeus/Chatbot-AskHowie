# Chatbot-AskHowie-Final-Capstone

My Final Capstone Project at Tech Elevator

Designed a Chatbot named AskHowie as a resource for Tech Elevator students. The application requires users to create an account then log in to get access to the chatbot chatbox. You can ask the chatbot questions about Java OOP, The Tech Elevator pathway program and some other fun things like tell me a joke. It will then give you resources to help you study, find a job, or prepare for interviews. The application also includes a pomodoro timer to help keep your mind fresh when you are studying. An about page that has info about the creators of the chatbot and the general function of the chatbot and a help page that dynamically fills a list of keywords the chatbot will recognize that are connected to a database that we designed. Java, Spring Boot, Axios, PostgreSQL, Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, DBVisualizer, IntelliJ, VSCode and Postman were all utilized in the construction of this application.
